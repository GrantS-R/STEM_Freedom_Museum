                    <h2>Welcome</h2>
                    <p>
                        Welcome to The STEM Education Museum. We aspire to shine a light on STEM 
                        education, in order to pave a brighter path for this wonderful new field.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        STEM education is important because it helps prepare students for the workforce, 
                        especially if those jobs are in a STEM or STEM adjacent field. Freedom in STEM 
                        education is important because it ensures that all people have an equally fair 
                        chance at STEM education, and thus STEM related jobs or just the workforce in general. STEM 
                        is a rapidly growing, and therefore lucrative field that everyone should have an equal chance
                        to interact with and, if they so choose, be a part of. 
                    </p>

                    <h2>Thank you for Visiting</h2>
                    <p>
                        Thank you for visiting The STEM Education Museum. We hope you have learned something 
                        new that you will take with you for a long time to come. STEM is truly a wonderful 
                        field, but its education is fairly lacking compared to other, older fields.
                        
                        If you are able, contact your local school board, ask them to include STEM in their education,
                        and if they already do, tell them to expand it.
