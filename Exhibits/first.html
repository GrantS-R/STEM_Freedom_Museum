                        For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology, or FIRST,
                        is the leading youth STEM education nonprofit in the world. FIRST gives 
                        kids the freedom to learn and create robots of their own in a competition format.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        FIRST has three different programs: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                FIRST LEGO League
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                FIRST Tech Challenge
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                FIRST Robotics Competition
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h2>FIRST LEGO League</h2>
                    <p>
                        FIRST LEGO League, or FLL, is FIRST's program for younger kids, operating 
                        from ages 4-16. FLL has 3 parts, but the other two just have kids experiment, 
                        and don't have them build much.
                    </p>
                    <h3>FLL Challenge</h3>
                    <p>
                        FLL challenge is the section for grades 4-8. Student teams are challenged to 
                        complete as many tasks with a robot of their creation in a set amount of time. 
                        Under adult guidance, teams must design, build, and program a complicated LEGO 
                        robot. They then take their robot to a competition, where they compete against
                        other teams. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Something to note about FIRST is that one of their guiding principles
                        is the idea of "coopretition". Teams are competing against one another, yes, but 
                        teams are also highly encouraged to help other teams, make friends, and enjoy the 
                        experience. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>FIRST Tech Challenge</h2>
                    <p>
                        FIRST Tech Challenge, or FTC, is a big step up from FLL. Made for grades 7-12, teams are given a game 
                        in September, and have to design, build, wire, program, and test their robot 
                        <b>from scratch</b> by as early as late October, when they have their competitions. FTC has
                        students learn real, applicable skills in STEM. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>FIRST Robotics Competition</h2>
                    <img src="https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/all/themes/first/assets/images/2020/frc/event-experience.jpg" height = 250>
                    <p>
                        FIRST Robotics Competition, or FRC, is another step up. For grades 9-12 only, FRC 
                        gives students from January to March to complete their robot. This is a longer period than FTC,
                        but it is justified, as the robots can get quite large, and complex.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Money Management</h3>
                    <p>
                        FRC gets much more expensive than FTC, so teams often have to fundraiser a good chunk of money.
                        Many teams manage to get sponsorships from various companies, mainly big tech companies like
                        Boeing or NASA. Others don't get enough from that alone, and have to find other income.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Outreach</h3>
                    <p>
                        FRC teams are encouraged, and rewarded, for making an impact on their community. Especially with 
                        little kids, teams spread STEM ideas and education throughout their community, going to events, 
                        hosing events or summer camps, and starting FLL or FTC teams. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>Impact of FIRST</h2>
                    <p>
                        FIRST has had a huge impact of thousands of lives, including my own. It is truly a wonderful program that should 
                        be offered in more places. Below is an infographic of the impact that they have.
