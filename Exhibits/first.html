                        For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology, or FIRST,
                        is the leading youth STEM education nonprofit in the world. FIRST offers 
                        kids the opportunity to create robots of their own in a competition format.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        FIRST has three different programs: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                FIRST LEGO League
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                FIRST Tech Challenge
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                FIRST Robotics Competition
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h2>FIRST LEGO League</h2>
                    <p>
                        FIRST LEGO League, or FLL, it FIRST's program for younger kids, operating 
                        from ages 4-16. FLL is divided further into three parts: FLL discover, FLL 
                        explore, and FLL challenge.
                    </p>
                    <h3>FLL Discover</h3>
                    <p>
                        FLL discover is the section for grades PreK-1. Teachers & parents are given a 
                        set of hands-on activities for students to explore and create. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>FLL Explore</h3>
                    <p>
                        FLL explore is the section for grades 2-4. In FLL explore, students are 
                        tasked with designing, constructing, and programming simpler robots. This teaches 
                        students the basics, which they can then apply in FLL challenge
                    </p>
                    <h3>FLL Challenge</h3>
                    <p>
                        FLL challenge is the section for grades 4-8. Student teams are challenged to 
                        complete as many tasks with a robot of their creation in a set amount of time. 
                        Under adult guidance, teams must design, build, and program a complicated LEGO 
                        robot. They then take their robot to a competition, where they compete against
                        other teams. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Something to note about FIRST is that one of their guiding principles
                        is the idea of "coopretition". Teams are competing against one another, yes, but 
                        teams are also highly encouraged to help other teams, make friends, and enjoy the 
                        experience. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>FIRST Tech Challenge</h2>
                    <p>
                        FIRST Tech Challenge, or FTC, is a big step up from FLL. Made for grades 7-12, teams are given a game 
                        in September, and have to design, build, wire, program, and test their robot 
                        <b>from scratch</b> by as early as late October. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Building & Competing with their Robot</h3>
                    <p>    
                        This requires teams to work out innovative solutions of their own, collaborate with 
                        each other, manage deadlines, and think like engineers. All of which are highly 
                        applicable skills in the workplace.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When teams go off to compete, it works a little differently than FLL. Teams are randomly 
                        paired, and compete in alliances for the game. They gain points by scoring pieces, or other 
                        miscellaneous actions. The best teams advance to playoffs, then states, then world-level 
                        competition.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Money Management & Fundraising</h3>
                    <p>
                        Not only do teams have to build the robot on their own, they also have to source the 
                        parts to build the robot. This requires researching what they need, where to get it, 
                        how much it will cost. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Speaking of cost, FTC starts to get into the area where teams have to find ways to fund 
                        themselves. Building a robot is expensive, after all. This can be anything from getting
                        sponsored by a local businesses or school, to kids going out and fundraising themselves.
                    </p>
                    <h2>FIRST Robotics Competition</h2>
                    <p>
                        FIRST Robotics Competition, or FRC, is another step up. For grades 9-12 only, FRC, 
                        similarly to FTC, provides students with a game at the start of the season, or "kickoff". 
                        FRC though, provides students from January to March to complete their robot. While this may 
                        seem unfair, FRC demands a much larger, more complex robot than FTC.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Building the Robot</h3>
                    <p>
                        FRC teams have to do all the things that FTC demands, but scaled up to 11. Robots in FRC can 
                        reach heights of 6 feet, and weigh over 100 pounds. Everything about the robot is more 
                        complicated in FRC. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Competing</h3>
                    <p>
                        The competition design is a bit complicated in FRC. Teams get randomly assigned alliances of 3 
                        for 10 matches each. They earn what is called ranking points by both winning, and completing 
                        various side tasks. Ranking points determine alliance capitans, who then pick teams for 
                        playoffs. This is all for one competition. Teams are guaranteed 2 district comps, and if they
                        qualify, district championships, and worlds. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Money Management</h3>
                    <p>
                        If you thought FTC was expensive, think again. Registration alone for FRC is $6,000. Robots can 
                        cost up to $10,000. Then there's travel, food, registration for districts & worlds if you get 
                        there, etc. Essentially, teams need <b>a lot</b> of money.
 
                        Many teams manage to get sponsorships from various companies, mainly big tech companies like
                        Boeing or NASA. Others don't get enough from that alone, and have to find other income. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Outreach</h3>
                    <p>
                        FRC teams are encouraged, and rewarded, for making an impact on their community. Especially with 
                        little kids, teams spread STEM ideas and education throughout their community, going to events, 
                        hosing events, having summer camps, and starting FLL or FTC teams. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Our Arlington Tech FRC Team</h3>
                    <p>
                        Here at Arlington Tech, we have our very own FRC team, the Koibots. The team makes up around 10% of 
                        the student population. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Last year, the Koibots made Cuttlefish (shown above), a small but fierce shooter robot that took thm to district 
                        championships. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>Impact of FIRST</h2>
                    <p>
                        FIRST has had a huge impact of thousands of lives, including my own. It is truly a wonderful program that should 
                        be offered in more places. Below is an infographic of the impact that they have.
