                        Access to STEM education is one of the most important things for students to get into STEM fields however not everyone has equal access to the same kind of opportunities starting off in
                        primary school a lot of stem teachers don't have degrees in the filed they are teaching in this number is especially high in low income areas meaning that some of the teacher are not
                        qualified. many student report that having bad instructors was one of the biggest obstacles when getting into stem education meaning they are less likely to pursue a career in STEM
                        because of poor instructors. another difference in access to stem is how much money people make most STEM after school programs are more expensive then after school programs that are
                        not stem orientated meaning that if a parent has the opportunity to send their kid to a stem program vs a cheaper non STEM program most parents will choose the latter, transportation
                        is also a issue because most families in low income don't have the ability to have a car to get to and from school which means that they have to really on a bus but sometimes the after
                        school busses don't align with the after school programs leaving kids to not have a way to get back home or to not attend the after school program , the final reason is that there
                        is not enough STEM programs in schools meaning that some schools don't even give a option for a after school stem activity
