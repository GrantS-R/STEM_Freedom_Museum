                    <h2>What is a Governor's STEM Academy?</h2>
                    <p>The state of Virginia has started a program to create Governor's STEM 
                        Academies. Arlington Tech is one of them. The purpose of the academies is 
                        to try and break down the barriers between education and workplace skills 
                        by merging normal academics with Career & Technical Education (CTE). 
                        Currently, 21 such academies exist, in a myriad of forms. Some are high 
                        schools, some are at community colleges, and others are online.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Career Pathway Requirements</h2>
                    <p>
                        In the guidance document used to establish guidelines for the Academies, 
                        more specifics are revealed. Academies are required to have two career 
                        pathways that meet the following criteria:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Allows for opportunity to earn credentials relevant to the career
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                One of the two has to be in a field that a statewide authority 
                                identifies as a strategic growth area for VA
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                One of the two has to be a high-skill, high-wage job, identified to 
                                be needed in the surrounding area
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                One of the two has to be in STEM
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
