                        The NASA logo is important because it symbolises all of NASA's work. Becuase it hasn't changed much, a recognizable version of it can be found on almost all of their projects.<br>
                        NASA had played a major role in STEM education because it has many opportunities for STEM and STEM adjacent internships. They also fund many smaller projects run in high, middle,
                        and even elementary schools. One example of this would be the Plant the Moon Challenge.
