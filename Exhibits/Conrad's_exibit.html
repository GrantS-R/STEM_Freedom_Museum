                    access to STEM education is one of the most important things for students to get into STEM fileds however not everyone has equal access to the same kind of opertunitys starting off in
                    primary school a lo of stem teachers don't have degrees in the filed they are teaching in this number is especcily high in low income areas meaning that some of the teahcer are not
                    qualified. many student report that haveing bad instructors was one of the biggest obsticals when getting into stem education meaning they are less likly to presue a cheere in stem
                    because of poor instuctors. another diffrence in acces to stem is how much money people make most STEM affter school programs are more expensive then affter school programs that are
                    not stem oriantated meaning that if a parent has the opertunity to send thier kid to a stem program vs a cheaper non STEM program most parents will choose the latter, transportation
                    is also a issue because most familys in low income dont have the ability to have a car to get to and from school which means that they have to realy on a bus but sometimes the affter
                    school busses dont align with the affter school promgrams leaveing kids to not have a way to get back home or to not attend the after school program , the final reason is that there
                    is not enough STEM promgrams in shools meaning that some schools dont even give a option for a affter school stem activity

                <p>This shows the government's attempts to increase STEM education in the US this document shows the progress they made and how much money they are spending</p>
                <p>This shows why this is important for the government and what they hope to achieve with it</p>
