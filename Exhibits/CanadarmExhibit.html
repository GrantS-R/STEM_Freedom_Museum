                        The Canadarm, shown above, was used in Space Shuttles and in the International Space Station (ISS) for a variety of reasons. These are:

                    <ul>
                        <li>To send satalites into orbit.</li>
                        <li>Capture damaged satalites for repair.</li>
                        <li>Assemble the ISS.</li>
                        <li>Support astronauts during spacewalks.</li>
                        <li>Film the experience of astronauts in space with two IMAX cameras.</li>
                        <li>Inspect the Space Shuttle's thermal protection system with the Orbiter Boom Sensor System.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        However, before the Canadarm could be deployed, it had to be built. To withstand the harsh environment of space, Canadarm was built with titanium, stainless steel, and graphite epoxy. The Canadarm was wrapped with a thermal blanket with controled heaters to protect the arm from the heat of the sun as well as the cold of the space.

                        Canadarm was outfitted with 3 joints at the "shoulder," "elbow," and "wrist," relative to their position in the human body. It was able to lift more than 30,000kg in earth gravity, and up to 266,000kg in microgravity. Canadarm both had automatic and manual modes, depending on what the astronaut needed to do. During the first deployment, nothing went wrong, leading to the Canadarm being used for 30 years, however is still in commision on the ISS.
