                        Scratch is helping with the freedom of STEM education becuase it is both web and
                        block based, which makes it much mroe accessible.

                        The sprites in scratch are used for displaying objects. They can range from anything like players and enemies to heads-up display elements. The sprite being shown in this image
                        is the default sprite in scratch, the cat sprite.

                        Scratch has played a major role in STEM education because it is a simple, easy to learn, programming language. This is important to STEM education because many people think that
                        learning a programming language is difficult, but Scratch provides an easy way to learn how to.
