                        57% of parents said that after school STEM programs where to expensive. this impacts students
                        in low income households because after school STEM can be very expensive with traveling to competitions and registration costs
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        53% of parents said that transportation issues/no safe way of getting home 
                        after school. this impacts low income family because they might not have enough money to buy a car
                        so takeing the bus is the only way to get to and from school. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        42% said that there was a lack of available programs in there schools.
                        this mainly impacts students in low income households, because they don't have the 
                        opportunity to go and participate is out of school STEM activities.

                    <p>This shows the government's attempts to increase STEM education in the US. 
                        This document shows the progress they made, how much money they are spending,
                        where it is going and what they hope it will achieve. while this is a good first step it dose not talk about how they will get kids to participate in STEM activity so the impact this has is limited.</p>
