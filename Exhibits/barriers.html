                    <p>
                        Access to after school stem program is very important to kids educational freedom, and future financial freedom.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        57% of parents said that after school STEM programs were too expensive for their kid to take part. This impacts students
                        in low income households because after school STEM can be very expensive with traveling to competitions and registration costs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        53% of parents said that they had transportation issues/no safe way of getting home 
                        after school. This impacts low income families that might not have enough money to buy a car,
                        so takeing the bus is the only way to get to and from school. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        42% said that there was a lack of available programs in their schools.
                        This mainly impacts students in low income households, because they don't have the 
                        opportunity to go and participate is out of school STEM activities.
                    </p>

                    <p>This shows the government's attempts to increase STEM education in the US. 
                        This document shows the progress they made, how much money they are spending,
                        where it is going and what they hope it will achieve. While this is a good first step, it 
                        does not talk about how they will get kids to participate in STEM activity so the impact this has is limited.</p>
