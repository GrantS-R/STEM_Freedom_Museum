                        The James Webb Space Telescope, shown above, was in consideration even before the Hubble Space Telescope was launched in 1990. Webb lets us:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>See deeper into space than ever before.</li>
                        <li>See "in to the past."</li>
                        <li>Get clearer photos of deep space than ever before.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Webb's studies of cost and fesability began in 1999, and the construction of the first pars of Webb began until 2004. After some issues and upgrades during development as well as testing on earth in vaccums, Webb finally launched on December 25, 2021. While people were hopeful, there was also fear before Webb was deployed.

                        Unlike the Hubble Space telescope, Webb was to be deployed far away from earth, and it would take over half a year for Webb to reach it's destination. This destination far from Earth was chosen for multiple reasons. The first, and most understandable reason, was because of the light polution from Earth. To take the best photos, Webb would have to be deployed far from Earth. The spesific location chosen by NASA was due to the abnormal gravity behavoirs in the location, allowing Webb to stay there. However, because of the distance from Earth, if Webb had similarly disastarous initial photos as Hubble, then there would be nothing we could do, and almost 20 years of work would be for nothing.

                        To the general public's relief, president Joe Biden released to the public the first photos Webb took, clear and without blemish, and Webb is still taking photos today.
