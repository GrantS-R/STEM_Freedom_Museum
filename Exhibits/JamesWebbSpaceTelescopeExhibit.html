                    <ul>
                        <li>See deeper into space than ever before.</li>
                        <li>See "in to the past."</li>
                        <li>Get clearer photos of deep space than ever before.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Webb's studies of cost and fesability began in 1999, and the construction of the first pars of Webb began until 2004. After some issues and upgrades during development as well as testing on earth in vaccums, Webb finally launched on December 25, 2021.
